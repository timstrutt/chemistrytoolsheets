## Description

I have been a volunteer ISO17025 technical assessor for a national accreditation authority for 30 years. I use an iPad, and made these tools to help me.

ISO/IEC 17025:2017 requires Measurement Uncertainty (MU) of chemical test results to be available - Particularly when developing new methods or for "novel" analytes and matrices. MUs can be determined by using sample blanks, spikes, and comparisons with reference materials. Sample "Low Spikes" could be used to determine Recoveries and Method Detection Limits. Spikes can be used to establish MUs at different concentrations with different matrices. Grubbs' test and the Horwitz Ratio (HorRat) are statistical tools that can be used for initial assessment criteria.

### SingleAnalyteMU spreadsheet

Is for one analyte, but also includes a printable "Summary Report"s that can be sent to a customer or archived. More information in ReadMe_SingleAnalyteMU.pdf

### MultipleAnalytesMU spreadsheet

Can be used for >20 results for each of 20 analytes in a test. Concentrations range from parts-per-trillion to 10%. More information in ReadMe_MultiAnalytesMU.pdf

### Sample Extraction spreadsheet

May be useful for the investigation of analytes in aqueous and solid materials in food and environmental samples - Including to prototype extraction methods for new analytes and to modify methods to improve their performance for a range of analytes. Several important published methods are included. A particular aim is to help reduce the use of chlorinated solvents by some older methods ("Green Chemistry"). Likely efficiencies can be compared using different solvents and amounts for similar matrices.

## Dependencies

This site only uses HTML and CSS for downloading spreadsheets and descriptions in their relevent PDFs. No Javascript, etc., is used. There are no clickable external links to other resources. The spreadsheets are in two formats:-

### Microsoft Excel
Designed for a desktop PC - Should work with MS Excel 2013 or later, Office 365, and Google Sheets.

### Apple Numbers
Designed for an iPad - Should also work with an Intel or Silicon processor Mac, iCloud, or a large iPhone (not recommended).
